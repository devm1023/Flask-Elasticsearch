# Flask-Elasticsearch

This is a Flask extension that provides simple integration with Elasticsearch.

## Usage

In order to install:
```
pip install Flask-Elasticsearch
```

In your main app file:
```
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.elasticsearch import FlaskElasticsearch

app = Flask(__name__)
es = FlaskElasticsearch(app)
```

If you're following the [Application Factories](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/appfactories/) pattern:
```
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.elasticsearch import FlaskElasticsearch

es = FlaskElasticsearch()

app = Flask(__name__)
es.init_app(app)
```

Now that you have the ```es``` object, you can perform searches. To read more about how to do that, see [Python Elasticsearch Client](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org).


## Customizing Properties

In order to customize the host, add the following into your app.config (see [Configuration Handling](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/) for more details):
```
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST = "10.10.10.13:9200"    # default is "localhost:9200"
```

If you need to use HTTP Authentication for the Elasticsearch connection, add the following to your app.config:
```
ELASTICSEARCH_HTTP_AUTH = "<INSERT AUTH KEY>"
```

If ```ELASTICSEARCH_HTTP_AUTH``` is not set, the Elasticsearch connection will simply not use authentication.
